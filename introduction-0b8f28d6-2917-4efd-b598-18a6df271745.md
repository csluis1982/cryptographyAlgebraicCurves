A. INTRODUCTION

Sometimes we want to avoid trouble in mathematics, and in the complex numbers many problems disappears elegantly. For example, consider the curve defined as $$
\dfrac{1}{z^2-1}
$$ in a domain $\omega$, in such a curve we want to avoid cases where the function explodes to somewhere else, these "explosions" are called singularities. They are defined as the points in which the denominator equals 0, and the function becomes undefined at that points, forcing us to have to define $$
\dfrac{1}{0} = \infty
$$, but this is just a bad work around for us, because $\infty$ is not properly defined either. What do we do is to make a conformal mapping, a mapping that is defined over an ideal infinity. Furthermore, the conformal mapping preserves the structure of the domain into the new region.
